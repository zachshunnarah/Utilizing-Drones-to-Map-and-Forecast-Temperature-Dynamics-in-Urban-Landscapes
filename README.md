# Utilizing-Drones-to-Map-and-Forecast-Temperature-Dynamics-in-Urban-Landscapes
Abstract:
With the many ways that technology has improved over recent
years, unique methods have allowed researchers to examine peo-
ple, places, and objects like never before. The question then be-
comes: how can these newfound technologies benefit society? This
research plans to answer that question, specifically through the
understanding of temporal thermal behavior in urban cities. Cities
have recently experienced record high temperatures, and this has
undoubtedly affected our everyday lives. By utilizing the capabil-
ities of drones, warming trends can be studied. Due to a droneâ€™s
ability to capture views that humans have more difficulty reaching,
research has become more extensive, specifically through infrared
thermal imaging. In this research, from 2021, 2022, and 2024, ther-
mal images were gathered of buildings, water, and other objects
that encompass the Harbor Walk area in the City of Charleston.
Through a comprehensive process, a mosaic of Harbor Walk was
mapped with temperatures available for data analysis. These mo-
saics allowed for pixels to be matched with specific locations, which
were accompanied by a temperature reading. Employing machine
learning techniques train regression models allowed for predictions
of temperatures in the future. This is important because predicting
temperatures can be scaled to much larger and more populated
urban environments. Further, trends from this data could provide
input for future infrastructure and landscape that combat the in-
creasing temperatures of today. The potential recommendations
that could arise would allow for urban cities to plan, prepare, and
predict for successes and failures regarding how temperature affects
its citizens, groundwork, and lifestyle.
